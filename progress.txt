created UserController to access the database directly, making api endpoints easier to create.
created login_required decorator preventing unauthorized users from making specific api calls

need to test api somehow (api authorization needs oauth token)
connect frontend to api so admin can create new employees and clients   
    - how do I create an admin account though? (chicken/egg)

create a Project object, and make it to where:

- employees can create projects and associate client users to them
- employees can edit/add to projects
- clients can view their project(s) and see the progress



make admin panel where admins can:

- create employees
- create clients




for each feature, figure out:
- what api endpoints need to be made?
- how can I connect each of these endpoints to different react pages?
